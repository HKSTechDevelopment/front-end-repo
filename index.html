	    <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is by no means the best development indicator. Nevertheless, it is an important one.</p>
	    <p> The graph presents the result of a shifting paradigm: the world GDP is gravitating from North America and Western Europe to East Asia, India and Brazil.</p>

		<p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> is a measure of income inequality, with 0 representing total income equality and 1 representing total income inequality. Income and wealth inequality have assumed a prominent place in American politics in recent years, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. Bernie Sanders made income inequality the center of his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Democratic Party nomination for president. Meanwhile, the idea that working class Americans have been excluded from the benefits of globalization was a major theme in Republican candidate Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric. This chart highlights state by state differences in income inequality. </p>

	<p> We also built gauges for gini coefficients, and specifically showing for our home countries (China, Ecuador and the U.S.). Gini coefficients are widely used in international development context as a measure of inequality. </p>
	<p> Though not a perfect measure, it does shed some light on a country’s redistribution system and economic fairness.  Gini coefficients, as reported by the World Bank, range from 0 (most equal) to 100 (most unequal). </p>
	<p> We also show gauges for Finland and Brazil as benchmark. As we can see, neither economy size nor population seem to be correlated with gini coefficients. A high level of inequality is present in a smaller country like Ecuador as well as in Brazil, the world’s fifth largest country by population and size.</p>

	  	<p> Often people think of the developed countries as the primary causes for global warming. It is historically true, in cumulative terms. </p>
		<p> Our bubble chart, however, tells the other side of the story. </p>
		<p> Our chart shows the top 12 countries with the highest carbon dioxide emission based on 2013 data. Among the top 12, developing countries accounted for more than 60% of the emissions that year. </p>
		<p>A closer look reveals even more. Among the top 5, three are developing countries including China, India and Russia. The other two are developed nations, U.S. and Japan. These three developing countries are now contributing more than twice as much as U.S. and Japan. </p>
